> THIS REPO HAS A RENAME AT 18.11 2025 SINCE IVORYHOOK

Why the rename? Well, the name “IvoryHook” sounded kinda unofficial and unprofessional, and honestly, I want this project to look a little more legit so, the rename is about giving it that also its  just a way to make it feel less like some shady side project and more like something worth actually checking out.
