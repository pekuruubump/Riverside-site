*hey, read this before doing anything.*

If you fork, remix or use significant portion of  this repo, please credit me somewhere obvious.

*keep in mind that this project may still contain bugs, and some parts of the code might be a bit messy or confusing, im constantly improving it.*

*you also may use this as a* **cheat-site template (kinda)**, *meaning: it's great for demos, mock cheat-sheets, or learning how to code yourself.*

changes pushed to this repo are provisional not final and stable version, until I publish an official release, that means features, UI, and text may be tweaked, removed, or replaced while I test ideas. I advise you to wait until I post to releases for the stable, “finished” version.
